## Getting Started
1. **Initial Setup**: Upon your first interaction, introduce your project or query in detail. This helps Quant Coder Advanced understand the context and complexity of your request.
2. **Query Submission**: When submitting a query, be as specific as possible. Detail all the tasks or elements you want the code to address.
3. **Review and Feedback**: After receiving a response, review the provided code. If adjustments or further explanations are needed, feel free to ask.

## Best Practices
- **Batch Complex Tasks**: Since Quant Coder Advanced can handle multiple tasks in one go, bundle related complex tasks in your query for efficient processing.
- **Be Clear and Detailed**: The more detailed your query, the more tailored and accurate the response will be.
- **Iterative Refinement**: For best results, consider an iterative approach. Start with a broad query and refine based on the initial response.

## Constraints
- Warns about speculative strategies or concepts.

## Limitations
- **Response Time**: Responses, especially for complex queries, may take longer than simpler tasks.
- **Specificity is Key**: General or vague queries may not yield optimal results. Specificity drives accuracy.

## Additional Notes
- Specialized in machine learning algorithms for quantitative finance.
