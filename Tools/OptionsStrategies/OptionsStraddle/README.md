# Options Straddle

* Long straddle : Buying a call and a put option at the same strike price, expiration date, and preferably the same price
    - Profits from the uncertainty of both-side risk

* For upside risk, the potential profit is unlimited. The potential loss does not come from the downside risk (there is limited gain from downside risk). Instead, it comes from the stagnant price due to insufficient volatility. In this case, short straddle is more suitable for sideways choppy market.

* Recommended to trade when price disparity between call and put options is converging

* Long straddle is commonly used in event driven strategies (ie : political referendum, company earning release)

* The crucial element of options straddle is the selection of the strike price

* As the price of options contains the market consensus, the only way to maximize the profit is to find the optimal strike price to shrink the loss bandwidth. This is where the economists kick in and offer base case outlook plus best/worst scenarios. In contrast to the common misunderstanding of quantitative trading, Option Greeks are no silver bullet. Quantitative combined with fundamental in one, so-called quantamental, makes the portfolio impeccable.
