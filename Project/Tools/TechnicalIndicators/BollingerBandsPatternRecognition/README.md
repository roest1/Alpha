# Bollinger Bands Pattern Recognition

* 3 bands of the Bollinger Bands are used to identify the pattern
  
* Upper and lower bands are two standard deviations away from moving average (mid band)

* Pattern Recognition: can test bottom W, top M, head-shoulder patterns, elliott waves, etc

The code uses bottom W (reverse of top M)
