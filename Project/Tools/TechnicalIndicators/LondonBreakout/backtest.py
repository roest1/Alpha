Need to acquire one minute frequency data

Can use this website:

* Uses New York time zone utc -5 for non summer daylight savings

* London market starts at GMT 8am = EST 3am

http://www.histdata.com/download-free-forex-data/?/excel/1-minute-bar-quotes

- We get one minute freq. bid-ask price

‚üπ Average of these is used to obtain price
