"""
Need to do:

Add trade execution logic:
- include the mechanics of opening and closing option positions. This should account for premium paid or received, and the impact on capital.

Position sizing and capital allocation strategies:
- Unlike stocks, options require careful management of leverage and margin requirements.

Performance Metrics: 
- Develop a comprehensive performance evaluation method, including metrics like Sharpe ratio, maximum drawdown, and profit/loss over time.

Trade Management: 
- Implement logic to manage ongoing option trades. This includes monitoring for stop-loss or take-profit conditions, and adjusting positions as necessary.

Risk Management: 
- Add risk management strategies, such as setting maximum drawdown limits or diversifying across different options strategies.
