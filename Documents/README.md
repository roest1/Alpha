**Suspicious curiosity is the most important principle in investing**

1. Recognize prevalent/obvious patterns

2. Uncover hidden patterns

3. Discover non-existing/unkonwn patters

**Being right**

"We're right 50.75 % of the time, but we're 100% right that 50.75% of the time. You can make billions that way." - Robert Mercer, co-CEO of Renaissance Technologies. (Jim Simmons)

## Estimate probability of entering a bear market

When stocks were about to enter a bear market, what was the probability of observing conditions similar to the present?

Let X be the unobservable probability of whether or not the market will be bearish over the next 13 weeks.

Let E be the observable evidence.

We can then go back to historical data and see when X is true and observe the E (evidence). We can also note when X is not true and find the E' (counter evidence) that was observed in that case. 

After calculating X and E, Baye's Rule can be applied.

**Possible E (evidence):**

* Inverted yield curve

* Put/Call ratio on SPY or VIX

* McGinley Dynamic Indicator

⟹ Bayesian Ensemble Methods

⟹ Tree Structure
