# Monte Carlo Simulation Notes

* Most ML applications in trading are leaned towards analytics rather than prediction

* Monte Carlo refers to the computer simulation of massive amounts of random events
    - Extremely powerful in studies of stochastic processes

* Cannot accurately predict the direction of the momentum under extreme events (ie: 2008 financial crisis)

* Weakness of Monte Carlo is you can't predict something in the future if it has never happened in the past
